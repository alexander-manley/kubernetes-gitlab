GitLab collects and displays performance metrics for deployed apps, leveraging Prometheus. Developers can determine the impact of a merge and keep an eye on their production systems, without leaving GitLab.

Reviewing and analyzing a server for availability, operations, performance, security and other operations-related processes. Monitor servers system resources like CPU Usage, Memory Consumption, I/O, Network, Disk Usage, Process, etc. GitLab uses the Node Exporter (via Prometheus) to expose an extensive set of machine-level metrics on Linux and other Unix systems such as CPU usage, memory, disk utilization, filesystem fullness, and network bandwidth.
